TODO:
* per-receiver settings that dont have to be in preferences.xml
* email page receiver
* xmpp page receiver.
* refactor out PageReceiver as an interface / base class.


PageReceiver "interface" - 
- receive an incoming message, decide if its a page, and insert it.
- receive intent for replying to a message. message text passed as an extra.
